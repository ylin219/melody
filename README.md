High   Level   description:  
This   application   draws   inspiration   from   the   IMDB.   The   app   allows   users   to   rate   and  
review   different   types   of   songs   and   albums   from   a   variety   of   artists.   The   ratings   will   be   out   of   five  
stars.   Both   albums   and   individual   songs   can   be   rated   out   of   five   stars.   Each   artist   will   have   their  
own   page   with   their   albums   and   songs   listed.   Each   album   will   have   its   own   page   with   a   review  
section   where   users   can   write   reviews   and   give   a   rating.   The   reviews   will   have   attributes   such   as  
date   posted   and   the   user   who   posted   it.   The   albums/songs   will   each   be   categorized   by   genre.  
They   will   have   other   attributes   such   as   date   released,   length   of   a   song   in   the   album,   number   of  
songs   in   the   album.   Each   song   and   album   will   also   have   a   list   of   rewards   attached   to   it.   Each  
song   and   album   will   have   a   maximum   of   three   artists.   Each   user   may   also   have   a   page   listing  
their   reviews   and   ratings.   There   will   also   be   a   specialized   user   in   the   form   of   a   moderator   which  
will   have   the   ability   to   remove   and   modify   inappropriate   reviews.  


Data   plan:  
  The   data   being   handled   is   all   real   data   from   the   users   and   real-life   artists.   The   data  
includes   user   data,   artist   data,   user   reviews,   user   rating,   metadata   such   as   review   time   posted,  
album   release   date,   number   of   reviews.   Most   data   will   probably   come   from   the   Spotify   API.  


User   interaction:   
Our   application   will   ask   users   for   a   song/album   title   or   an   artist’s   name.   If   the   user   input  
song/album   title,   our   application   will   return   the   description(genre,   artist   name,   release   date,  
background   story,   rewards,   etc.),   rating   and   review   as   results;   if   the   user   input   an   artist's   name,  
our   application   will   return   the   information   and   some   music   work   of   that   artist.   Each   user’s  
preference   on   music   and   artists   will   be   recorded   under   his   user   id   and   that   preference   could   be  
used   for   music   recommending   functio
